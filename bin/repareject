TEMPLATES: (REMOVED FROM MESSAGE)
=================================

Please fix the build error and try to rebuild the package locally (and major dependent packages too, if they're known):
- use 'gbs build' with a configuration pointing to the repository where the error was found.
- when everything builds fine locally, send you patch for review (gerrit)
- after the patch has been merged, re-submit to OBS to trigger a new prerelease build
- follow your submission on http://panel.tizen.org

MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS FOR THE SAME PACKAGE WITH THE SAME REVISION SHOULD BE AVOIDED:
1 - it's useless
2 - it's counter-productive as it load the build system for nothing
3 - it's a waste of time for Release Engineers
Except when explicitely asked to do so, please avoid to submit multiple times for build.

MULTIPLE DEPENDENT PACKAGES SHOULD BE SUBMITTED IN A GROUP SUBMISSION, not in multiple single submissions.
Please read the following documentation: https://source.tizen.org/documentation/developer-guide/getting-started-guide/contributing-code-tizen , chapter 3.1.2.

YOUR SUBMISSION COMMENT DOESN'T HELP. Please, take time to write a message that will help the release engineers to better understand why you submitted. It can be as simple as "Bug Fix TC-xxxx" or "Bump to version x.y.z". But messages like "Updated" are useless.

WARNING: YOU SUBMITTED AN OLDER REVISION OF THE PACKAGE. This is probably an error, as the submitted revision is already in the current project. Please update your git tree and re-check. If this second check hadn't been done, we would have gone backward for the package, potentially reintroducing bugs that were fixed by the latest revisions. 

PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN SUBMITTING:
- always get the latest updates on your local git tree (git fetch, git pull)
- double check that you're on the correct revision to be submitted (git log)
- check that it hadn't been submitted previously (https://panel.tizen.org or git tag)
